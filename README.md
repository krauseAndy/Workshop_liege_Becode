# Workshop: animating the web with css and javascript

## Workshop ambitions :

- understand when to use CSS keyframes and when to use libraries (like Greensock, my tender <3 )
- build a few animations on top of an HTML page, with CSS that I provided.
- understand the benefits of each and get a first grip.

## The programme.

### Then we took a step forward with javascript and jquery with GSAP library

To do so i've created a webpack config file that can reload the browser every time the is a change.
Also i have implemented axios to make AJAX request easier :)

#### Installation

You just have to clone the repo then go to the downloaded folder and run the command.

```
npm install
```

To watch the file in the workstation you need to run.

```
npm run watch

```

- By default the browser will go in the public folder.
- In the URL you need to put a `/index.html`

#### First Exercices

- the first exercices was to play a little bit with TweenLite and just change the DOM.
- i have a very good method to explain how elements can move on a page :)
-
- We play with opacity height width and control X & Y positions.

#### Second Exercice play with the Timeline

- I just did a brief intoduction on how timelinemax works.
- Then i show them a timeline scene to reproduce and it went prety well for almost every one.

#### Animation on Scroll

- So yes we did some greate animations with TweenLite TweenMax TimlineLite TimelineMax.
- But i want to show the animation on scroll.
- That is why i choose ScrollMagic.
- First Step: TriggerElement on when to start the animation
- Second Step: Add the tween we have created before. Just put de name of the animation \* variable in the function :p
- third step: DEBUUUUG :p (part of the job and the workshop) ;)

#### Third and last exercise

- i let you enjoy the header if you want to clone the repo.
- I've just pick the animation from awwwards website to proove that animations are not that hard ;)

#### enjoy ;)
